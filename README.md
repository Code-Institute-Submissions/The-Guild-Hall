## The Guild Hall 

The Guild Hall is a site that helps players, both new and old to find Dungeons and Dragons games running in a fictitious tavern called "The Prancing Pony". 

It aims to entice new players into trying the game for the first time by giving them a number of reasons as to why they should take up the hobby and how the perception of the game and those who play it has changed in recent years. 

 
## Features

- Navigation Bar
The navigation bar can be found at the top of each page. It allows for easy navigation to each page of the site, without the user having to use the 'back' button. 
- The landing page image
The landing page image is a picture taken from the official WotC website and has a text overlay to catch the user's attention.  
- Cross platform
The site is fully responsive for a convenient user experience whilst being viewed on a number of different devices. 
- Club Ethos Section
The club ethos section shows the user four good reasons why everyone should try playing dungeons and dragons and should encourage them to sign up to the club. 
- The Games Times Section
The games times section allows the user to see what games are being played at which times and the gifs behind the text should also give some indication as to the theme of each game. 
- The Video Section
In the video section, I have included a YouTube video on the resurgence and rising popularity of Dungeons and Dragons in recent years. 
- The Footer
The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for The Guild Hall allowing easy access for the user. 
- The Gallery
The gallery provides the user with pictures for them to have an idea of what a game looks like and would be able to help them identify people playing the game. 
- The Sign Up Page
This page allows the user to sign up for any current games. The user is asked to submit their name, email address, and current level of experience.
- Features left to implement
In the future, I would like to add links to "let's play" videos so the user can watch games being played.
