        <h2>TAKE A CHANCE ROLL THE DICE</h2>
        <div id="left-about-one">
        <h3 id="about-head">It works your imagination muscles.</h3>
        <p>If you don’t know anything else about D&D, you probably know it involves dice and talking. And you know what? That’s pretty much all you need. Everything else happens in the group’s collective imagination, with each person adding their own brush strokes to the picture. This game stretches your creativity and imagination in ways many of us probably haven’t experienced since childhood.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>It builds camaraderie.</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever played a team sport, performed in a play, attended summer camp, or any number of other group activities, you probably know the special bond that a group of diverse people can form when they work together to overcome challenges and achieve a common goal.</p>
        </div>

    <div id="about-center-one">
        <h3 id="about-head">It improves your problem-solving skills.</h3>
        <p>Most Dungeons & Dragons games are really an extended exercise in problem-solving—just with the most zany, mind-bending problems you never imagined you’d face. Like sneaking past a horde of zombie goats. Or convincing a dragon that he does not, in fact, want to eat you and your friends. When you’re challenged with questions and puzzles you’ve never considered before, you start thinking new and creative ways to solve them.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>It helps you develop empathy.</h3>
            <p>If there’s one thing we could all use a little more of in our day-to-day lives, it’s empathy. And there’s no better way to practice understanding how others might feel than to…well…imagine how others might feel. Stepping out of your own perspective and into the perspective of, say, a dwarf warrior who’s trying to save his family from a horde of zombie goats forces you to look at things from a totally new worldview.</p>
